    "**Data Acquisition:** Toronto city has 11 boroughs and 103 neighborhoods. Inorder to segment these we need a dataset of these and also we need\n",

Based on most common types of venues present in every neighborhoods, We can decide which neighborhood is good place to live based on client requirements\n",

    "**Data Cleaning:** Data from these sources is acquired through web scraping library BeautifulSoup and made it in tabular formats for analysing. Geospatial coordinates data also acquired from csv file and made it also as tabular format. By combining these 2 tables we got structured format data for analysation.\n",

    "**Feature Selection:** We removed the postal codes after above steps as they are not needed for our analysis. From Foursquare API, we extracted 100 common venues of each neighborhood and get the top 10 mostly occured ones. Based on these common venues, we can able to select the best neighborhood for our client to stay. Using Folium library, we have displayed map contains clusters of neighborhoods and analysed.\n",

From this, we get 3 clusters where we can decide which neighborhood is suitable for living based on common venues\n"

So, we can avoid such places.And also Lawrence Heights,Lawrence Manor is also best suitable as it is also having good amount of store, household items stores, which is mostly liked by ladies. From resultant clusters. we can conclude that avoid places having more number of airports, construction sites, liquor shops. So we can consider other neighborhoods also when these are least common venues"

    "In this study, I analysed the clusters based on most common types of venues of neighborhoods using KMeans machine learning clustering algorithm. This clustering model built 3 clusters based on common venues and displayed particular neighborhoods on folium map. I analysed each cluster along with neighborhoods and venues and based on map, we can able to decide which place is near to more number of traffic places so as to avoid those. Here if the client is foodie, he can opt for good amount of restaurant places. If our client has interest in shopping, he can opt for places which are having good shopping places. Any person don't want to stay in more traffic related places so as to avoid congestion."
